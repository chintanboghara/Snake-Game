# Snake Game

Snake Game, a modern take on the classic arcade game! Control your snake as it slithers across the screen, eating food to grow longer and increase your score. But beware of colliding with the walls or your own tail, and it's game over! With multiple difficulty levels, achievements, and customizable themes, this version brings new life to the timeless gameplay.

## Features

## How to Play

### Objective
Guide the snake to eat food items that appear on the screen. Each piece of food makes the snake grow longer, increasing your score. Avoid crashing into the game boundaries or the snakeâ€™s own body to keep playing.

### Controls
- **Desktop:** Use the **Arrow Keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) or **WASD** keys (W: Up, A: Left, S: Down, D: Right) to steer the snake.  
- **Mobile:** **Swipe** in the desired direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) on the screen to control the snake.

### Scoring
- Eating food increases your score, with point values varying by difficulty level.  
- Power-ups may grant bonus points or temporary score multipliers.

### Special Elements
- **Power-ups:** Look out for occasional power-ups that provide advantages like slowing the snake, granting invincibility, or boosting your score. Use them wisely!

### Tips for Beginners
- Start with the easiest difficulty to master the controls and gameplay.  
- Prioritize avoiding collisions over chasing food aggressively.  
- Time power-up usage strategically for maximum benefit.

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```  
   The development server will start, and the app will be available at the URL shown in the console, typically `http://localhost:5173`.

### Docker Setup

The project includes Docker configurations for both development and production environments.

#### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Development Environment
- **With Hot Reload:**  
  ```sh
  docker-compose --profile local up
  ```  
  Starts the development server with hot reload enabled. Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

- **Standard Development:**  
  ```sh
  docker-compose --profile dev up --build
  ```  
  Builds and starts the development environment. Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Production Environment
